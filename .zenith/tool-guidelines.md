# Tool Guidelines

Read this file with `file_read` only when you need details beyond a tool's schema:
what a tool expects, what it returns, and the rules for using it correctly. For
general queries and simple reads the schema you already have is enough.

## General rules

- Scope every glob to a subdirectory; never `**/*` from the repo root (it matches
  node_modules and .git and floods context).
- Inspect a folder before writing into it so you do not overwrite or duplicate work.
- After creating a file, do not write it again; to change it, file_read then file_edit.
- Batch independent tool calls into a single response; never batch dependent ones.
- After generating a project, install its dependencies and run its tests.
- If a verification step cannot run here (no network, missing runtime), say so
  explicitly; never claim it succeeded.
- Answer general queries directly in markdown; do not call tools for them.

## Tool reference

### file_read
- Purpose: read a file (or a slice) from the workspace.
- Input: `path` (required), `offset` (0-indexed start line), `limit` (max lines).
- Output: numbered lines `N: content`; metadata includes `total_lines`/`showing`.
- Guidelines: read small slices, not whole files; use offset/limit to page through
  large files. Path must stay inside the workspace.

### file_edit
- Purpose: change an existing file via exact search-and-replace.
- Input: `path`, `old_content` (exact text to replace), `new_content`.
- Output: confirmation of the applied edit.
- Guidelines: read the file first so `old_content` matches exactly.

### file_write
- Purpose: create a new file or overwrite an existing one.
- Input: `path`, `content` (full file body), `overwrite` (bool, default false).
- Output: `Created <path> (<bytes> bytes)`.
- Guidelines: missing parent directories are created automatically - do not run
  mkdir first. Do not include placeholders; write the full intended content once.

### bash
- Purpose: run a command in the workspace (tests, builds, installs, git).
- Input: `command`, `timeout`, `run_in_background`, `auto_background_after`.
- Output: stdout + exit code; long output is head/tail-trimmed with a marker.
- Guidelines: use PowerShell syntax on Windows, bash on Unix (see the env section).
  Use it only when no dedicated tool fits. Long commands are moved to a background
  job; poll with job_output / terminate with job_kill.

### glob
- Purpose: find files by glob pattern.
- Input: `pattern` (required, e.g. 'app/**/*.py'), `path`.
- Output: matched paths, capped at 500 results.
- Guidelines: always scope the pattern to a subdirectory; never `**/*` from the root.

### grep
- Purpose: search file contents by regex.
- Input: `pattern` (required), `path`, `include` (file filter).
- Output: `path:line: content` matches, or "No matches found".
- Guidelines: scope `path` so results stay small.

### discover_capabilities
- Purpose: list every capability and the tools that provide it.
- Input: none.
- Output: capability list with read-only/mutating flags and tool names.

### get_tool_definition
- Purpose: load the full schema + metadata for a tool not in the always-on set.
- Input: `tool_name` (required).
- Output: JSON with the tool's function schema and metadata.
- Guidelines: call once per tool; loaded tools persist for the session. Never load
  a tool you already have.
